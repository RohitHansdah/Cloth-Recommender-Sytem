**Introduction**

I built a recommender system which recommends the clothes to the female customers for their
rental purpose. The renting purposes depend on the activities a user wants to carry out, such as:
vacation, meetings, weddings, dates, etc. The recommendation is based on the features like
customersâ€™ height, weight, bust size, body type, age, and reason to rent. Since a customer might
not know their body type, we are predicting their body type for our calculation. â€˜RandomForest
Classifiersâ€™ is used to predict customersâ€™ body type on the basis of their height, weight, bust size,
and age. The objective of this project is to group the users by their predicted body type and renting
purpose and apply collaborative filtering on them to recommend the clothes to our customer, based
on the ratings of the most similar user. The goal of recommending the clothes is to improve the
customersâ€™ shopping experience and preserve the ongoing trend in fashion world.

Looking towards the implementation part, I have taken the dataset called â€˜renttherunwayâ€™ from
http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#clothing_fit. The raw data provided by the
customers comprised of categorical values, which were converted into the numerical values for
calculation. In case of numerical data, customer records with the missing values are handled by
applying mean-mode imputation. However, categorical data with missing values is handled by
binning strategy, which is applied throughout that features of the complete dataset. This is how the
data is preserved by handling the missing values and avoiding dimensionality reduction problem.
